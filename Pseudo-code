Whack - A - Trump

need a picture of Donald Trump's face gaining points for every successful hit
hit Hillary's face and you lose point, hit barack, you lose a life.

each level points increase
Create a grid using html with 4 by 4 squares using list items
Set three different random classes - 1 for trump, 1 for hillary, 1 for obama
Set a function that randomly picks.
Start with 3 lives -
-hit Obama, lose a life
-four levels
-at the end of four levels, each life converts into 50 points, and is added to final score (is this a good way to do it?)
Use counter to increase score and lives

Set timer to 30 seconds
function 1 - trump
  -add trump class
  -set it so the class appears, then disappears for a second and then reappears
  -listen for click
    -if click appears, add 10 points to final score
    -if click appears, randomise sound bite (optional)
function 2 - hillary
  -add hillary class
  -set it so the class appears, then disappears for a second and then reappears (same at trump)
  -listen for click
    -if click appears, remove 10 points from final score
function 3 - obama
  -add obama class
  -set it so the class appears, then disappears for a second and then reappears (same at trump)
  -listen for click
    -if click appears, remove 1 life
function 4 - randomise which function to run


JS
create a 3 x 3 grid with a black circle over the middle with an image of trump and hillary on either side. (potentially wearing boxing gloves?)
start a timer for 30 sec
have images of trump come up in an increasing speed and listen for the click event to earn points
have 4 levels that increase in speed and a different image for each level
use trump sound bites that play after 2 or 3 click events
